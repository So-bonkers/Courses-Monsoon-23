## System Calls fro Process (Unix)

fork() - Creates a new child process
exec() - Makes a process execute (runs an executable)
wait() - Causes a parent to block until child terminates
exit() - Terminates a process

* Many variants of the above calls exist
* **init** process is the ancestor of all process

Why create a child process?
-> Parallelism
Distribution of tasks
Parent process requires the completion of child processes
init() process starts everything, but do you want it to do EVERYTHING?
Every process has its own responsibility

Why do we need to know the id?
- > To distinguish between child and parent
- > Parent needs to know when the child process finishes executing
