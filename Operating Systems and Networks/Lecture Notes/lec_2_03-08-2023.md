## Virtualization of Processes and Memory

### What is a Process?
* A program is nothing but code
* Processes are **running program**
* There can be more than one process running ... TBC

### Process Virtualization
* Each process feels that it has its own CPU
* Even in Single core machines - There can be multiple process that run at the same time
* How is CPU handling this?
  With limited CPU can we create an illusion that Endless CPU's are available?
    OS achieves this using Virtualization of the CPU

**Q:** Can you think of how this is achieved?
- Do different processes get broken down into multiple steps and then jumbles and completed?
- What is the intuitive way of achieving this?

### Some prereqs:
CPU -> Memory -> Video Controller -> Keyboard Controller -> USB Controller -> HDD Controller
*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
|                                  Common Serial Bus                                       |
*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

As we go away from CPU, the more time it takes.

### Prereqs - Comp. Hardware

* CPU contains some registers
  * Temp Registers
  * Program Counter (PC), Stack Pointer (SP), Data register, address register
* Some key registers
  * PC - Points to the next instruction
  * SP - Points to the top of the stack in the memory
  * Program Status word - Status of current state of CPU and program (condition bits)

### How does CPU execute a program?
* Three stage pipeline
     Fetch -> Decode -> Execute
**Q:** Do you believe that the current hardware structure is similar to this?

### How to make it at software level?

* We do need support from the hardware
  * Some mechanisms to switch
  * Eg: Each process run for a particular time and then we switch =
  * Low-level mechanism (Context Switch)
* We also need some intelligence in the software
  * Some algorithms that can intelligently decide
  * Policies for switching
* Basically, we need - **low-level mechanisms** and **policies** (CPU schedule)

## What Constitutes a Process?
