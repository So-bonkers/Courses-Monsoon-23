4th Aug 2023

## A brief history of Cognitive Science

* The roots date back far in history but the real genesis of the interdisciplinary cog sci field lies in the 1950s
* Symposium of Information Theory (MIT) - Sept. 1966
* Alan Newell, Herbert Simon(Computer Scientist), Noam Chomsky(Linguist), George Miller (psychologist) presented work that each took a cognitive turn
* Miller (1979) wrote about how he left the sysmposium with a conviction about how **experimental psychology, linguistics, computer science can be used to simulate mental processes**

## Developments in Psychology

* A huge influence of ***behavirorism*** early on in psychology: B. F. Skinner even opposed positing **internal processes** and focused on only what was observable: **behavior changes with stimulus (and reinforcement/reward structure) changes** 
* However, some people though differently, Tolman for example even posited that rats navigate through mazes by forming cognitive maps.
* Behaviorim and S-R (Stimulus-Response) -> Cognitivism and S-O-R models N computational view of the mind N connectionism N dynamical systems approaches.
* (Mind is there to help you compute)
