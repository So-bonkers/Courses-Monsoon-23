## Hemodynamic Response

* Slow!
* The change in MR signal from neuronal activity  = hemodynamic response
* HRF = hemodynamic function is a model fit to many empirical observations of HR or a transfer function linking neural activity with FMRI signal, modeling neurovascular coupling.
* This hemodynamic response logs the generating neuronal activity ... TBC

## So if it measures blood flow, is it really strongly related to neuronal activity?

* Although we know that fMRI works based on metabolic demands of increased neuronal activity, this process is not well understood and therefore, fMRI is only an indirect measure of neuronal activity
* Nevertheless, there have been demonstrations that they are indeed tightly linke.
