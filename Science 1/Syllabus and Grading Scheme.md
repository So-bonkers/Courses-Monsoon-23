# Syllabus:

## 1st Week
1. Introduction: (visual presentation) The relevance of basic science for an IT student, a popular level presentation on symbiotic relationship between computer technology and science, the semiconductor, nanotechnology, molecular logic, keyword level ideas of quantum computing and DNA computing (without details). **1L**	

2. Scales in Nature; time scales (atomic unit to the astrophysical time scales), length scales (radius of an atomic nucleus, size of a DNA, living beings on earth, to light years), energy scales (1 Hartree to fusion in the sun). Equations similar in appearance but describing processes of different scales, dimensionless numbers **1L**

Skills learnt: units and dimensions, dimensionless perception of a problem.

## 2nd-3rd Week
Mathematical modeling in sciences,

1. geometry and linear algebra, Geometric profiles of variable quantities (physical properties described as algebraic, trigonometric and other functions of variables like temperature, etc.), e.g., harmonic oscillator potential, Hooke’s law force, etc.,

2. change and calculus, expression of a spatio-temporal change in terms of a differential equation, the diffusion equation, the heat conduction equation, equation of continuity, (simple conversion of natural observations into mathematical forms)

3. vector formulation of a multi-variable problem, coupling of variables described as matrix elements; example of symmetric and asymmetric stretching in CO2 described as normal modes of nuclear motion. More examples on web page and assignments. (derivations of solutions for the model problems will not be taught in this section; solutions may be provided on the course web page), **1-2L **

Skills: modeling of simple problems. 

## 4th-5th Week

Forms in Nature (mostly visual presentation): molecular structures, crystal lattices, biological molecules, fractals and self organized structures, basic ideas of symmetry and group theory.

Examples of linear and nonlinear structures (visual presentation), variety of nonlinear forms like trigonal, pyramidal, tetrahedral, octahedral, fullerene structures etc., cubic (simple, fcc and bcc) crystal structures, packing, etc., examples of simple fractals
**1-L**
skills: imagining diverse forms.

## 6th-8th Week

Relevance of thermodynamics, - the thermodynamic space, state and path functions, work, heat, mechanical and thermal equilibrium, The macroscopic laws of thermodynamics, 0th law and temperature, Work and Heat as ubiquitous components of energetics, internal energy, 1st law, enthalpy, entropy principle and the concept of a potential function, free energy, the chemical potential, 2nd law, applications to phase transitions and chemical equilibrium, understanding natural processes, chemical potential, coupled reactions, thermodynamics of photosynthesis, transformations as processes in an energy landscape, etc. 
**5L**

skills: describing natural problems in terms of energetics and spontaneity

## 9th-10th week

The need for a reductionist approach in science, Mechanics, predictability, Newtonian and Quantum, indeterminacy in the subatomic world, the generalized coordinate, examples of forces and interaction potentials and their interrelation, the phase space, simple harmonic trajectories in phase space, anharmonicity, interaction between two atoms described in phase space, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, geometric view of dynamical systems, angular momentum, laws of conservation. **4L**

Skills: basic principles of mechanics
